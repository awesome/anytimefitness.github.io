Truth be told, this post serves little purpose.

We're building out our blog with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [Git Hub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), I needed a post to flesh out the HTML and CSS. This post serves that purpose wonderfully.

As way of introduction, we're the tech team working at [Anytime Fitness](http://anytimefitness.com/). Yes, we're a fitness company, but that's why we decided to make a tech-oriented blog. We want to fight the natural bias that only "tech" companies can have awesome tech teams.

Real posts will soon follow to prove (or disprove I guess) our awesomeness.
